			Are you a Death Eater? is a Harry Potter version of the party game Mafia(also known as Werewolf).<br><br>
			
		
			At the beginning of the game, you'll be  secretly assigned a role affiliated with either the Death Eaters or the Hogwarts
			students. The game is played in alternating phases: Night, in which Death Eaters attempt to covertly 'murder' the students,
			and Day, during which the students attempt to figure out which players are secretly Death Eaters. The game ends when the 
			students have eliminated all the Death Eaters or the Death Eaters have picked off all the students.<br><br>
			
			Game Play<br>
			The game begins with a Night phase, where a moderator will ask all players to shut their eyes and 'sleep'. The moderator 
			will then ask all Death Eaters to awaken. They will silently learn which other players are Death Eaters and then choose 
			one student to 'kill'. After the Death Eaters have made their choice, the moderator will ask all of Hogwarts to awaken for
			the Day round and announce who has been murdered. The students (and Death Eaters masquerading as students) will then debate
			and try to figure out who is secretly a Death Eater. At the end of the round, the moderator will call for a vote, and one 
			player will be 'sent to Azkaban' (a fate equivalent to death in the context of the game). The players will then learn the
			identity of the player they selected, with students hoping to have chosen a Death Eater and Death Eaters hoping to avoid 
			being caught. Night and Day phases then alternate until one side has eliminated the other. <br><br>
			
			Cardinal Rule<br>
			The game is most interesting when all possibilities are left open and nothing is known for sure. Players can then infer, 
			theorize, lie, and persuade. The only hard evidence should come when players are killed and flip over their cards.<br><br>
			
			Cardinal rule: You may say anything you want, but you may not show your card for any reason until you are killed and
			eliminated from the game.<br><br>
			
			Additionally: Dead can NOT talk. Dead may watch the rest of the game with eyes open, but dead may not speak to living players.
